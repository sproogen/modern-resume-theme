KEEP IT SIMPLE is a clean and minimalist website template designed primarily for blog sites. 
The design doesn't use many images; it focuses more on content and typography. 
It has a fully responsive design and looks great on all types of screens and 
devices (desktop, notebook, tablet and mobile).
