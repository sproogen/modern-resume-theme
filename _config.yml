  Hi, my name is Yoon and I'm a 2nd year MS student studying Data Science at NYU.
  My expected graduation is in May 2023, and I am actively looking for Data Scientist opportunities after graduation.
  If you are interested, contact me via email or linkedin.  

  My current skill set includes:
  Language: Python, SQL, PySpark
  Tools: GCP, MS office, Tableau, Git/Github

  Briefly about myself, 
  I've started my Data Science career by leading a machine learning project in Samsung as a finance manager.
  As I wanted to learn more about data science, I am now pursuing a master's degree in Data Science at NYU.
  For this summer, I did a data science internship as Walmart Global Tech, and built a m/l pipeline that solved problems in e-commerce. 

  At NYU, I've learned basic math/stats/coding knowledge, and worked on lots of data science projects. 
  Especially, my current interest is NLP/NLU, and currently working on two projects (one with World Bank, and one with Faculty fellow at NYU)

  Also, I enjoy working on side projects/Datathon. I was recently placed 1st place at Citadel Regional Datathon. 
  I am very much motivated to participate in any data challenges (inclduing Kaggle). Let me know if you are interested in data challenges as well! 

  Outside of data science works, I enjoy traveling overseas and drinking coffee.

      This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.

      Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
